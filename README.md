# Food Delivery App Using Blockchain and ReactJS

## Vision

The vision of this project is to revolutionize the food delivery industry by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and efficient system. The aim is to ensure that all transactions are immutable, trustworthy, and decentralized, empowering both customers and restaurants with seamless and reliable services. By integrating blockchain, we aim to eliminate middlemen, reduce costs, and provide a more direct connection between food providers and consumers.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Powered Transactions**: Secure, decentralized transactions using blockchain to ensure transparency and integrity.
- **Real-Time Food Tracking**: Track orders in real-time from preparation to delivery, ensuring a seamless customer experience.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated, self-executing contracts to manage payments, refunds, and promotions without third-party interference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive UI built with ReactJS, providing an intuitive experience for users.
- **Decentralized Review System**: Customer feedback and reviews stored on the blockchain to prevent manipulation and ensure honest ratings.
- **Tokenized Rewards System**: Loyalty and reward tokens for users and restaurants, encouraging engagement and repeat business.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, CSS, HTML
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (or any preferred blockchain), Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage, or a traditional database like MongoDB for non-blockchain data
- **APIs**: Integration with Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interaction

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-blockchain.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd food-delivery-blockchain
   npm install
   ```
3. **Setup Blockchain Environment**:
   - Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for browser blockchain interactions.
   - Configure a local Ethereum blockchain using [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) or connect to a testnet like Rinkeby.
   - Deploy Smart Contracts using [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file with the following details:
     ```
     REACT_APP_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_key
     REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_smart_contract_address
     ```
5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
6. **Smart Contract Deployment** (Optional):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat deploy --network your_network
   ```

**React Components:**

* **Header.js:** Contains the top navigation bar with the YumKart logo, search bar, cart icon, and user profile.
* **InventoryList.js:** Displays the list of food items with their images, names, prices, and quantity counters.
* **FoodItem.js:** Represents a single food item in the list, including its image, name, price, and quantity counter.
* **Footer.js:** Contains the bottom navigation bar with links to different sections of the app, such as home, cart, and profile.
* **BlockchainIntegration.js:** Handles interactions with the blockchain, such as fetching product information, verifying authenticity, and tracking supply chain data.

**Blockchain Components:**

* **Smart Contracts:**
    * `ProductRegistry.sol`: Stores information about products, including their origin, certifications, and supply chain data.
    * `MarketPlace.sol`: Manages the buying and selling of products, including payments and order fulfillment.
    * `Token.sol`: (Optional) Implements a token system for reward points or loyalty programs.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **API Integration:** The app likely interacts with an API to fetch product data, user information, and order details.
* **State Management:** A state management library like Redux or Context API is likely used to manage the app's state, including the user's cart, current inventory, and blockchain data.
* **Styling:** The app's design and layout are implemented using CSS or a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components.
* **Testing:** Unit and integration tests are essential to ensure the app's functionality and reliability.

**Note:**

This analysis is based on the provided image and assumptions about the app's functionality. The actual implementation might vary depending on the specific requirements and design choices of the project.


## How It Works

1. **Order Creation**: Users select their desired food items and confirm the order.
2. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Order details are stored in the blockchain through smart contracts.
3. **Payment Processing**: Users can pay using cryptocurrencies. The payment triggers the smart contract.
4. **Order Tracking**: The status of the order is updated in real-time using blockchain.
5. **Delivery and Review**: Upon delivery, users can leave reviews stored immutably on the blockchain.

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic React setup with blockchain integration.
- [x] Implement Smart Contracts for food ordering and payments.
